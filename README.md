## My blog app with Rails MVC and API

Done with these techs:

- Mailjet
- Sentry
- Custom url with gem 'friendly_id'
- Paginate
- Crontab with gem 'whenever'
- Postgres
- Rails 7
- Ruby 3
- Auto deploy with Circleci

You can view my deployment of this application [here](https://rails-blog.online/) (it may take sometime to load if the server is sleep, because it 's free) , or you can use the button below to deploy your own version.
